{"text": " M, C, P, the model context protocol. It's a protocol that gives your LLMs, your coding assistance, your agentic IDEs. That's a little bit more information. That little bit more control that helps you do things so much better. There are usually used in the form of MCP servers, and they can do things from like interact with databases, to, I don't know, read additional documentation. Today, I'm going to show you how you can set up the neon MCP server, on MCP server, and the Rust Crate MCP server on Kero, so we can build some cool things with some databases, and some Rust packages. Let's do it. Let's set up this MCP servers on Kero. Let's start off with neon. Now, neon is your fantastic server, a small square database out there in the cloud, and this MCP server basically allows Kero to interact with this database. It can do things like create projects, create tables, make SQL queries, incredibly good when you want to build a project that includes the database and neon. To do that, the simplest way to configure it, we're going to call all the way down to the local MCP server, and we're going to take this whole thing here, or not the whole thing. This part, that just says neon, if we take the whole thing, this is the whole MCP configuration, I'm just going to take this a little bit, and I'm going to go into Kero. Now, with a project open, you click on the little ghost icon on the left hand right side, and underneath the MCP servers, there's a little edit button. Click on that, and you get this wonderful little MCP server, I'm going to add a little comma here, and I'm going to paste in the thing. Now, you may see here that already have an MCP server, I have the 80-bit of docs MCP server, but in this case, I'm just going to add that neon MCP server. I'm going to add another little thing here. I'm going to add a thing that says disabled. I'm going to say false. Good. And I just need to go ahead and replace this neon API key with a proper API key, but I'll do that in a second, because I don't want to show you my API key. Before I go and change that, I'm going to go ahead and get one more MCP server. I'm going to get the crates docs MCP server. Now, this is an MCP server written in Rust, and it's basically used to bulk up crates, basically rust packages, right? And it's slightly different than the one you've seen before, because it doesn't use like NPM or NPX or DockerTron, it's just a binary running on your system. To install this thing, you just select this whole thing, go into a repository where you have or somewhere you want to go ahead, and let me just clear this here. You would basically just paste in this, get clone and build. Once this thing is built, now I have this thing built already. Once this thing is built, you're going to run the command call cargo install dash-path. Basically, this will install the binary that the application within this repository locally on your file systems. That means if I run crates docs, I'm going to get this MCP server as a binary on my system, which is just fantastic. Now, to set this up on MCCuro, I'm going to just do another thing exactly the same as I did here. I'm going to copy this thing. I'm going to go here and paste it in, bottom like that. I'm not going to call it neon. I'm going to call it crates docs. Command is going to literally be crates docs. Create docs. I don't need to go ahead and set up an MPX thing because it's literally a binary running on my system. I'm going to delete all of these things and I'm just going to set up a single parameter here and it's going to call the STDIO. Because I'm going to use the STDIO version of this MCP server. Pull comma here, so it all looks good. I think that looks good. I'm going to go ahead and just input my API key here because I don't want you to see it. One moment please. Okay. My key is somewhere down there. I'm not going to show it to you. It's literally just the next line over. But on the left hand side, you will see that all of these things are connected. If you click on crates docs, you will see all of these available tools to this MCP server. On the left hand side, you will see all of these neon tools. There's a lot of them here. Beautiful. We are ready to go. With our MCP servers available, let's go ahead and make some changes to our application. In this case, this is an empty rust project. We don't have anything. So we're going to go ahead and buy code. Some functionality into it. And we're going to kind of tell it to use MCP servers in a roundabout way. So I'm going to paste in a big old prom here that what I tell it is that before we start coding, let's go ahead and create a project on neon called old computers. This will contain a database called vintage. In there, I want to store a database of old computers. What I need, there's a following, columns ID, manufacturer, model, amount of RAM, CPU, type, main storage, rear release, in order not to duplicate, I want to create a separate tables for CPU, type, main factory is main storage, and then I will then use foreign keys to connect to them. So basically, I told it, this is how I want my database to look like. It should be smart enough to pick up the MCP and run it. So I'm going to open up this so we see the MCP in action. Hit this button, and a cure goes ahead and starts executing this one. In a moment, you will say it's going to run the MCP server called create projects, both. Basically, it has created a project out there on neon. The next step is going to be creating a database in this case. Let's see what it's going to do, but you will see it's going to be an MCP call. Look at that. I know that this is not going to work, because it's, you'll say, run it. It should fail. Well, yes. The reason it fails is because it cannot create a cannot run created based inside of a transaction block. So it's smart enough. Okay. First, let me create the database. And then what it's created in the database, it's going to go ahead and, well, add the tables. So we'll get this is all creating the tables. Beautiful. In fact, show us CPTops, main storage types, and computers. Wonderful. All foreign keys. Wonderful. I love all of these things. I think even for the sake of our, a safeguard project, it's going to go ahead and add stuff to the database. So it's not getting the database table, so it's going to just ensuring that this thing is happening. Excellent. Your new project is the, the foreign keys, excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent. Ready to start adding some plastic computers to, I'm going to do it. Can you add add some sample data? I'm going to tell you just add some sample data into this data, so we can work on it. Right. And because of the MCP, it can actually go ahead and insert certain things like Apple. I'm OS 65 or two. I think it's going to be an apple or something, except this run a SQL contraction. Again, running actual SQL transactions, with your API key on to neon, and it's going to be adding those things in there. So in a moment, we will see it's actually adding an, a computer here. It's going to be an apple through 977. I love it. Okay. Perfect. Now, because it's going to run as SQL queries, it can also query the data inside. I think it's going to be running a normal select query. Look at that. Yes. Select query. I'm going to go ahead and output this data for us here. Look at that. Apple, Commodore, Tandy, Glorious. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful. This is a simple example. You can use the MCP server to interact with the database. What we're going to do right now, is we're going to ask it to build us an application that uses this database, and it's going to use the crates docs MCP server to go ahead and find out which correct crates, which correct versions it should use. Okay. Let's do a little bit more vibe coding. I told you that basically to use a build me a Rust application who correct that will use correct crates to query data from this database. Make sure to use the latest versions of crates and the appropriate crates features. I don't know that use crate docs if needed. So let's see if it's going to go ahead and actually use the crates doc MCP, which we so graciously have here in the list of our MCP servers. I'll help people. Let's see. Sometimes it's actually quite confident in which ones it has to use, but it's I see it reads my cargo tunnel and my main RS file. Let's go ahead and see what it's going to say. Okay, perfect. It's going to go ahead and look for my crates using the search crates, SQL async database. Perfect. It's probably going to get SQLx or Tokio, of course, those are kind of the crates you need to do it. And the thing is, it's a, is a, is a experience that I'll pre know what things should go there. However, sometimes it doesn't get the latest version. It goes for all this version. You know, you really don't want to do that. Correctly, it's using SQLx as the crate here. Perfect. Looking up Tokio, all of these things. So what it does here, when it goes and looks up, looks up at a crate. It actually gets information a little bit of the docs about this specific crate and the current versions and all those things. So it is very, very useful for it to be able to get you the correct information for your cargo tunnel file. It's going to go ahead and search for stuff. Of course, search a JSON, of course, dot envy. And so it's going to look for environment variable crates, which is great. One of the problems that, that, that the LMS had in the past is that when they would use rust projects and use environment for environment variables, they would usually use the dot end of crate, but that's an outdated crate. So the dot envy one is the correct one. And as I can see here, it has actually searched for the latest version of dot envy, which is really, really good. Looking a bunch of crates like it's going to go ahead and collect all of this data. That it needs, it may already have this data internally, but this is going to get you the latest version of this data. Once it's started working, once it's started adding stuff to cargo to the tunnel, okay, well, it is doing it right now. Perfect. So it's adding stuff to cargo to the tunnel. In a second here, we should be able to see things added. Perfect. Here's the SQLX, Tokio, survey, anyhow, all of these things, and it's actually got us the correct features of those specific crates. In a second here, we'll be able to edit our main dot RS file. I'm going to assume here in a sec. We should be actually able to create the correct data structures. Perfect. So the thing is, it's going to be able to, well, it's actually remembered. It's going to be able to look up stuff here. Oh, actually, you know what, see, it hasn't even looked up my database. So it has kind of guessed what I want. As you can see, CPU, memory megabytes storage type. So it wasn't, it wasn't intelligent enough to go ahead and check what, what, what database we have. I am actually going to go and start to cancel it. Update, give even just a second. So I told it, just to make sure to use my neon project, call the old computers. And because of this, it's going to, oh, okay, I'm so sorry. I'm going to go actually, look at your project. And it's going to be able to get my database key mine, or all the tables I have, look at that. And look at the old computers project. And it's going to use all of this information now. And go ahead and change my application. This is the power of MCP servers. It gives you additional context. So your applications can not only kind of do things in isolation, but actually be able to, get information from somewhere beyond. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, correctly generate code because now it knows my database schema set of me having to provide that information manually. Once it's done this, let's, let's, let's go back to once, once it's such generating some cool code. Okay, it's doing something. After a little bit of back and forth, it, it has actually made the code. It's going to go ahead and run, um, cargo run here as you can see. It's compiling the application. Uh, and a couple of seconds. Hopefully it compiles successfully. And let's see what happens. If it doesn't, we're going to have it fixed. So let's have a look. Beautiful. This, that it actually goes ahead and, knows how to connect to neon specifically. Okay. We do have a couple of issues here. Uh, there's a couple of errors here. Uh, set aside trade bounds, all of these kinds of things. Okay. So it's going to be going to, it's going to understand these things. Okay. Wonderful. It, it has shell integrations in this case, so it's going to be able to kind of look at all of these things. And it needs to know, it needs, and like, it, it, it understood that it needs to enable the rest, decimal feature in SQLx. Beautiful. So let's, uh, it's going to go ahead and make some changes right now. And once it's back, um, we're going to see it in action. One of the issues that notice here, it doesn't have access to compile time at macros. That's the beauty of SQLx because it can do compile time checking of SQL queries. In this case, we haven't set up that connection here, so it's going to not going to use those compile time macros. It's going to just use normal things because it's going to cause issues. It's created it clocked that early on. So back to fixing code. Okay. Almost successful. I see that it started putting computers. Wonderful. But everybody had a panic. Something happened. Um, uppercut's working, but there's a top miss patch issue with average function or returning numeric instead of float 8. Okay. In essence, if works, but it's going to has a couple of bugs. You're going to go ahead and fix it out because up miss match types. Got a lot of type system and rust. And just like that, fixed wonderful demo completed successfully. Now, this demo wasn't here to teach you how to do do rust and use SQLx and connect to any on database. None of that. There's so many more tutorials you can follow, but it was here to show you how simple it is to connect MCP servers to Kiro. Your new favorite coding assistant. So go ahead. Let me know what are your favorite MCP servers down in the comments below. I do want to hear your suggestion because so many new things come out every day.
