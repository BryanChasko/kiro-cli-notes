## Accessible Summary

This tutorial demonstrates setting up Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers on Kiro, covering three specific implementations: Neon, NPM, and Rust Crate MCP servers.

### MCP Protocol Overview
**Model Context Protocol**: Provides LLMs and coding assistants with enhanced information and control capabilities for improved functionality.

**MCP Server Functions**:
- Database interactions
- Documentation access
- Extended tool capabilities
- Enhanced development workflows

### Tutorial Content

**Three MCP Servers Covered**:
1. **Neon MCP Server**: Database integration capabilities
2. **NPM MCP Server**: Package management integration  
3. **Rust Crate MCP Server**: Rust ecosystem integration

**Setup Process**: Step-by-step configuration and installation procedures for each server type, demonstrating practical implementation in development environments.

### Technical Implementation
- **2,758-word detailed transcript** covering complete setup procedures
- **63 visual frames** showing configuration steps, terminal commands, and interface interactions
- **Hands-on demonstrations** of each MCP server installation and configuration

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding MCP protocol fundamentals
- Practical server setup skills
- Integration techniques for development workflows
- Enhanced AI assistant capabilities through external integrations

### Visual Context
The tutorial includes comprehensive visual demonstrations across 63 frames showing terminal interfaces, configuration files, installation processes, and successful server implementations.

### Accessibility Features
