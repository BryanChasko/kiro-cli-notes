# Kiro Powers: Empower your AI Agents with Specialized Expertise

**Video**: Kiro Powers: Empower your AI Agents with Specialized Expertise  
**Duration**: 1:52  
**Video ID**: M46PSAXpMfA  
**URL**: https://youtu.be/M46PSAXpMfA

## Accessible Summary

This video demonstrates Kiro Powers, a system for extending AI agents with specialized capabilities through modular expertise packages.

### Audio Narration Summary

The narrator explains that Kiro Powers bundle specialized development and deployment expertise into MCP servers, steering files, and hooks that can be dynamically loaded by Kiro agents when needed. 

**Key demonstration**: Adding Stripe payment functionality to a SaaS application:

1. **Installation**: Download a Kiro power from Stripe at Kiro.dev
2. **Activation**: The power becomes available to Kiro agents in the IDE
3. **Implementation**: Ask Kiro to activate it and add subscription functionality
4. **Stripe Integration**: Kiro interacts directly with Stripe to create:
   - Product configuration
   - Pricing structure  
   - Payment links in Stripe Dashboard
5. **Application Integration**: Kiro confirms subscription handling logic is integrated
6. **Deployment**: Deploy using CDK on AWS Serverless Infrastructure
7. **Testing**: Run React frontend to test account login and subscription creation
8. **Payment Processing**: Users can make payments with credit cards for unlimited plans

The video concludes by encouraging developers to build and share their own powers.

### Visual Context - Complete Workflow Sequence

**Frame 1**: File explorer dialog showing folder selection with sidebar navigation (Applications, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.) and file listing area with blue "Select Folder" button.

**Frames 2-4**: Development environment showing:
- Dark theme code editor with syntax highlighting
- Multiple code files open in tabs
- Terminal/console output with green text indicating successful operations
- Blue progress bar showing active processing
- File tree navigation on left side

**Frame 5**: Minimal interface showing "ProjectHub" with a blue progress bar, indicating application initialization or loading state.

**Frame 6**: Clean web interface displaying "ProjectHub" with progress indicator, showing transition from development to deployment.

**Frame 7**: Stripe payment interface showing:
- "$20.00" pricing display
- Payment form with card input fields
- User profile section with avatar
- Blue "Subscribe" button
- Professional payment processing UI

**Frame 8**: Subscription management page showing:
- "Subscription" header
- "Current Plan" section
- Plan details and pricing
- Red action button (likely "Cancel" or "Manage")
- Clean web application interface

**Visual Workflow**: The sequence demonstrates the complete development-to-deployment pipeline: file selection → code development → processing → application deployment → payment integration → subscription management.

### Key Technical Concepts
