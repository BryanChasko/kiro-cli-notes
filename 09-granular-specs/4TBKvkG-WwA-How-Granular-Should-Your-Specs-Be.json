{"text": " Today, I'm joined by Jack and Jack is going to talk to me about him using coding assistance, him using AI powered software development and cool things he's built, cool things he's learned and he's going to teach me a little bit more about how Kuro tools like Kuro help them build stuff. So, Jack, help the audience who you are, what are you saying? And what's objective with the best programming language? Wow. Okay. Hi. I'm Jack Carrington. I run a YouTube channel called the Blue Caller Coder. We specialize in full set coding, so mostly like next jazz, tan stack start, I'm on the tan stack team and also we do a lot on AI. Okay. So, I think that's kind of nice intersection here. And recently I'm talking a lot about MCP. This is kind of become a new passion of mine. But what's the objective of the best programming language? No, everybody uses to answer that question. Today. Oh, you know what? I'll answer it. TypeScript. Yeah. A couple years ago, I would say JavaScript, Slash Topship was the most important language in the world. I would say today the most important language is Python because of the so much of a big of a option. I'm not saying Python is good. You said objectively the best. There's an RFC doc that explains certain words. Oh. What's the one this? I must could use the word. Exactly. The mask out for me. Exactly. I think we should have the same thing for important, best objective of the best language is. Right? Because you're like objectively the best, like for what? Because it's rust. So that's what I'm saying. Oh, nobody's ever answered the question. Well, heck of that. Oh, my answer. Let's go ahead and talk about stuff. So you've built a lot of touch fib. What's the little project you were in your part of a ten stack? What's that thing? So ten stack is it's Tanner Linsley's P built React Query back in the day. And everybody loves React Query. It's sort of fantastic MPM module for doing like clients like Queries and all that. And then it's kind of expanded out of that. And now he's got his own router. So he's got Tansack Rack Ratter. And he's got this new one, Tansack React to start. There's also solid start. So he's not only doing so for React, but also for solid, developers building four developers. There's no VC backing. It's always on sponsorships. And so I love that, okay? Yeah. So you've been, you've been in the industry for a while. You've been stuff a little while. A little while. You've built up with that tripped, and now in this new world, the new paradigm of AI, driven developers, or whatever you want to call as vibe coding, Spectrum and development. Right. Every week, there's a new term. You know, I've started calling vibe coding traditional vibe coding, shenanigans. So tell me how this has changed, you know, kind of the way your approach coding now with all of these assistants. Like, you know, I'm going to go on a limb and say it's made you more productive. But how, how have you changed your way of code, what was the kind of a brick wall you hit if you hit one? Yeah. So a lot of different styles in the day, like a lot of my stuff is just simply autocomplete stuff. I just want to iterate over this thing and sum up these blah, blah, blah, blah, filter this down. Yeah. Yeah. Because I always want to try out new things, and I obviously want to get into all of these different code editors and how they're using MCPE, because it's interesting to me. And so, yeah. It's taken like a cure out. Yeah. And it's pretty interesting. So you've been using cure for the past while. So we lost cure. Like, I'm not so long ago. And you've been, you've been using it before, we even launched. Right. How are your progress or how are you progress your code and your code? The first thing I tried out was a pretty simple thing. I did it. Had it built like a tick-toe game. Did you try to show a vibe coding? No. I did this step, driven to all, because I really want respect to driven to all the things. So I really want to understand how that would work. And that was really cool because, you know, you go to like a, you know, be zero or cursor and you ask for a tick-toe game is like, every scene is the thing that they have about like the vibe, the rules of vibe coding or one of them is like, if you don't like the result then just be roll. Okay. You know, a lot of tokens. Yeah. Oh yeah. Right. That is a lot of tokens. But what I was really impressed by was like after I had gone through the design requirements and all that and I'd actually taken a look at it and I spent the time like when I hit go, it actually did a really nice job like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, building that and then at the end of it after I had gone through like a couple of rounds of like good and unit test going and all that. It was solid. It was so much more solid than I've ever seen any of the other tools build. Okay. So you went into this spectrum of development for Tech Tech, which you don't build for your business. Which I don't know. Sure. Okay. It's a good test because, you know, what I can do is I can take like quad code and all the different like various things and say like, hey, try building this and I can kind of see like what's it doing? Yeah. And then I can do like my MCP stuff on top of that so I can see like okay, well what's, what is the trust flow and yada yada yada and that worked well. So that went super well and then when I got into like okay, I want to build like a full stack app like and not even like a big full set of like basically do a day job like take this big well mock, right? Which we all get like a picture pixel perfect, pixel, you know, big well mock and then bootstrap and app. Okay. Which is not that's not that usual because usually you're in, you're just bringing the existing app and then have it connected to a back end. So in the end, hey, we had this big well mock to make a real form, go and take the data and then put it in and use MCP along the way and it was, it was good, but I got to say it really broke down the task like a really heavy level like it went to like 14 different steps with which to me is kind of interesting because like and I wonder if that's, you, you being on Kiro, like, is, how should I model mentally? I don't think matches what I think of as a spec. When I, if I were to go to you and I would say, let's talk as a team, like, I'm going to tell you to make this form. That is literally one item right in a spec. Yeah. Like, is that the same for Kiro? So with Kiro, like, you would say, even if you give it that incredibly simple task, it's going to generate a bunch of tasks. Yeah. So like, even if I felt like, oh, just implement this parameter thing is going to go, oh, I'm going to create a set of tasks to do it. And the thing is, those tasks are going to be very simple. Yeah. Like, oh, generate a false structure as a task. Right. Make our class. Yeah. So it will always keep like a relative, a long list of tasks. However, it does it for its own sake because it's going to be able to do that better. And my advice to all of you up there, people on the internet, is don't try to boil the ocean. Like, yeah. I think that's why my mistake was. I think I gave it almost too much meat on the bone. I mean, you know, we kind of are all impressed by these tools. Like, oh, it's a magical little ghost that can kind of build my applications. But, but, well, it can do a lot of stuff, give it a give to the hand. So like, we love to think about it like it's your little, I don't know, call them intern. But your little coating goes to the body and you give it instructions. Okay. So listen, I want to build this feature in my application and approach spectrum and development as more of a, I'm going to go in the phrase, feature spectrum and development. These just think. Yeah. Okay. So, but basically trying to do a little bit of a time because number one, you remain in control. And number two, it's easier to roll back from something, if something, if something actually goes wrong, or it's not just going wrong, but it does something that you don't really want to do. Yeah. So like, giving it minimal requirements and like what I like to do is like create an application that takes a video file as a parameter and a necessary bucket as a parameter. Take that file, send it over to the subscribe, return to me, the transcription, print it on the screen. Right. Nothing more. If you want to test, please. Right. Yeah. So like, I give it a little bit that kind of a strict instruction and like nothing more than this and it keeps to that. So my mistake, if we go back and look at like, where would that be in my design? Where would it be requirements? It would be requirements. So this is going to have my initial prompt. Yes. Well, actually, where was my initial prompt? I think the initial prompt is going to be somewhere else. I don't know if your initial prompt is actually being saved anywhere. Oh, no. Because it's being generated there. I should have called me that. Sure. But this is the requirement. Right. So think about it in this way. Yeah. The 10-sex start. Make a 10-sex start at app. We've got the connectemongo. Like, how would you, instead of having that all be one prompt, it would be like, maybe create a 10-sex start app with that that's stuck on. Done. Exactly. And then import, you know, the Figma mock into my app, make a, you know, a form. Right. Exactly. You try to break it down. Like, what's the, what's the bear bones? What, what would be the bear bones element of your application, right? Would that be just a front end? Maybe that's the first thing. But let's do front end. This is one thing I find that a lot of folks, particularly junior engineers, like they skip over, is like, there actually is a thing to just getting it running. Oh, yeah. You know, and it's like, okay, start, we're going to build an XA app app. You know what, the first thing we're going to do, we're going to run the, the next-sex creator, and we're going to get it running, and we're going to see it come up, and then we're going to commit that as one change, because literally, like, sometimes even that, particularly like Python world, that is in itself a hoop to cross. Exactly. Because if you don't have that then, you don't, you don't have any fallback for when it's like, oh, well, I did all the, I added, I added, I added, I added, I added that, and it's like, well, what is it? When did you ever check that it was working in all that flow? Exactly. You may start from one and another. Like, I've seen people start it from the front end. Yeah. I want to mock up on my application. Like, there's a Figma file, run with it, right? Yeah. Or like, there's a Figma MCP go with it. The other side is like, I just want an API that produces JSON, right? And then you build on top of that. Yeah. So, but you basically need to take one part of it instead of the whole thing. In absence of my saying that, what it did was it started from the back end and went to the front end. Okay? Which is interesting. In my head, that sounds very obvious, because that's how you do it. Right? But it may not be, like, for a lot of people may not be. Well, I think it depends on what you're doing, like, in the environment doing. Sure. Like, I was at a little company, actually, whatever, doing hosted social networks. Sure. Adding. At the time you're adding, like, virtual coins. Okay. It's a big deal. Back in, like, 2000 something. Okay. Right. You wanted, like, give you a ghost-to-point. Okay. Okay. And we did that. Where we normally were doing the kind of startup flow of, like, hey, we're just going to go and build something that looks like something and we're getting some feedback on it. We're going to iterate that sort of thing. We decided to go with this model of, like, okay, we're going to have the back end team go off and build the API. They're going to deliver it out to the front end and so on and so forth. And at the end of it, which took a while, the CEO kind of, like, sought for the literal first time and was like, I don't want to eat. What is this? Like, I don't like this at all. And so it is interesting. It's like, if you want to go with that style of rapid iteration around going with the UI first and then if the UI works, cool, we'll make a back end, cool, get that working. And then when we get it all working, we'll go and, like, make it, you know, kind of brought it out, which is actually that really the tagline in my channel, which is, like, make it work, make it good, make it fast. Then I think, yeah, as you're saying, like, you have to prompt it for that. And you have to, like, say, okay, I'm going to ask you to go and take this Facebook mock and go all the way to the back end, but I really, what I really want you to do is I want you to start with the front end to show me something. And then we'll go from there. And there's ways around it, right? There's work. You can add those things to your prompt. I can kind of tell you, when you do your specs stuff, hey, here's how I'm going to put an example of prompts right here on top of us. But like, here's an example of how you should, you know, give me an application that does this. But start with just the front fan, make sure to use the thing mock up, ID, blah, please use Tailwind CSS. And you kind of give it, like, start off with that. Question for you. Yes. Is there a way, I mean, that's a big prompt. Is there a way where I can give it kind of the context for this application, which is, by the way, eventually this application is going to be a full-sack application and we're going to use Mongo for this, Mongo, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so that when it's making these choices along the way, that it says, oh, okay, you're asking me for an API now, I'm going to use server functions for that, I'm going to use this for that. What, how would I do that? Well, Jack, thank you for asking that question. Did I do this? You know what? So I mean, I, I really didn't try that, there's no script, but like, you know. So there's a thing called Steering Docks, Steering Docks, which is a fast bet, and that's that. Yeah, it's a fast enough for rules, right? Okay. Steering Docks are basically your, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's something that, the, the cure will take, then, when you are building something, okay. And that's where I put, this is going to be a 10-deck, and this is going to use, Mongo. Exactly. This is going to use this. Exactly. And like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to also show a little bit of my screen, right? Oh, yeah. So, agent, right? This is basically a guiding agent, so basically going to cure a halt to do stuff. It can generate Steering Docks, I can tell just generate my Steering Docks, and then based on my existing application is going to generate Steering Docks, which is going to, kind of tell cure, what this application is and how it's building, how it can continue building it. Yeah. If you want to be proactive, you go ahead and plus the button and the document on yourself. Got it. What I would do here is work with Kiro on the side, tell us, hey, listen, I'm looking to build this 10 stack application. Yeah. Let's design it. Okay. And you design it. And you drop it a Steering Dock. Like a design. But it's not actually going to make it. It's just as you, as you build out features. Exactly. It's going to look to that dock and it's going to say, okay, if, in absence of, of knowing nothing, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. And then you go also. Okay. You can also build, build, build, build, build on the score progress at ND. And this is how you instruct it to build this application. You must start with the front end. You do. Right. And this is, when you go ahead and trigger Kiro to give you like a spec, generate the spec, it's going to look at your Steering Docks and say, okay, let me start with the thing. And like, I will not generate any unit tests or like, I will not generate mock data. You can give them all those things inside of the Steering Dock. It's, it's perfect. The Steering Docks are now per project. So they're not like a global Steering Dock unfortunately. So far. But it's, it's a great way to kind of, Can you enable them, like, can I, yeah, can I enable them on the fly? They're all being consumed inside of the context, right? So Kiro is smart enough to do it from what I know you have to. Because there's definitely times on like, I, I don't want to say that I don't do API I, I, I do sometimes, like, if I know, hey, I'm going to be building this thing. And I know that the API is going to look like X, Y, or Z. Like your transcription app, right? I would probably do that API driven, right? So in that case, I might say, I want you to work for the API first. Versus like, ooh, I just want to go and, you know, show this to the customer. It doesn't even need to work. You know, is that, can I enable like a, ooh, I want to spike driven thing where it's like, I want to eat, eat the UI first. That's what I mean. By enabling it. It's all going to exist inside of the doctoral directory. Okay. I see. So you're moving it in, move it out. Okay. It's a Markdown file, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Markdowns are rocking. I love Markdowns. I love Markdowns. I love Markdowns. I love Markdowns. I love Markdowns. I love Markdowns. I love Markdowns. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like, oh, she's in college. Yeah, of course. To like, you know, gray hair professor guys like, we only use a lot of tech. Oh, my god. Seriously. But in this case, is there a way to like, um, three, um, you just very, Okay. Okay. We kind of overview of my application. Uh, what does it look like? Okay. Okay. Yeah. And my next act. So anything that we go ahead and start building this is going to consider these things, but that part of my text act. All right. And how did you do this? So, um, if you have no agent sharing, there's a big little button says generate agency. Okay. And it kind of looks to your app and it says, um, is that, exactly. Okay. Well, I can also add a document here, like let's do, uh, I don't know. And more of like a product manager level back in it. Like, you know, part of the empty, right? I can say I can say like, um, always talk in the air. Any time, any time you respond. Oh, Lord. Uh, respond. Do it as, uh, as about air. Yeah. Not, okay. Say it. Okay. So it's going to be the part of the empty. Yeah. That's a good test. Yeah, like this. And I will say, I don't know. I think I can. Yeah. Are you in the middle of hearing some tests? I can do it. Let's do a button. I will have to say. Okay. You know what? A little button. Oh, yeah. Is this the video? Yeah. Is this okay? Okay. So let's say, um, what's the option? By the way, I would love this. Once you get this working. I, well, it's public. Oh, looks at it. Still can't build in public. Yeah. Sounds good. Sounds good. Yeah. So looking. Uh, yeah. Looking. Coming out can't Say. There may be no direct. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, I get it. It's kind of like the, you know, is it working? It's working, you know. It's the ultimate? I want to have a conference. So, right? I'm going to do it as like Morgan Mendida. I think it'd be hilarious. So these things can incredibly augment your application. So it's such an amazing view. Yeah, that is great. Okay, cool. It's great. So that would be one of the ways you could use the application. No, let's go back to your. Okay. It's tearing down. Yes, sir. Because we're not tearing up. You're like the requirement. So we have your application here. What is the application for so long? So the idea is, and I started a slightly different thing. But it would be take this like profile info form, implement that form, and then store that in a database. I'm longer database. And so when I set up Kuro, let's see, MCP. Okay. So here's my MCP control. Okay. I've got your tan sack in there. This is my stuff. Oh, look at that auto approved. That's great. It's got MongoDB. This is the MongoDB. MCP servers. Yeah. It's able to get to my MCP. And then Figma. And this is actually kind of cool. I don't know. I've never seen the MCP people. I've been using Figma very loosely, but I haven't seen the MCP, but looking at it, it feels like it starts like a remote. It starts like a listener. Right? Yeah. So here's it's very cool. You have to use the desktop app. Sure. Which is interesting. Because they're avoiding off. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I don't know. So. And then you go over here to their dropdown. And you say. Enable. Dead. MCP server. And then literally. This is the worst UI in the universe. You got to check this out. So like they. You know. Let's go. So like MCP is now giving. No. Or if it's when it comes off. But watch this. If you enable it, it actually comes up with this tiny little thing. You can't select that. It's in like eight point font. You got to remember. Oh, it's gone. Good luck. And now you got to go in like. Okay. Now I got to go over here. That is just where the. The kids playing it home. It always seems to be 38.45. Okay. Okay. So you. There you go. And it's on screen for a while. But anyway. It's really cool. And what it can do is it basically allows the. Curo in this case. L.M. Claw. Whatever. To go in access. Whatever. You're selected on things. Sure. So I could go and click on this. You know, form in here. Just that. Just to put that. Okay. And then it's going to go and get the raw HTML code. Which is not great from figuring out because it doesn't actually know that like this is an input. It just knows that this is like a rounded div or whatever. You know, that kind of thing. And then. Claw will then come in later and actually say, Oh, well, that kind of looks like an input field. And then it'll turn into a input field. In my case, the Schatzian input. I'm still waiting for my front page 98 times to be server. So we can. Show that's the front page. No. Yeah. Really. I used to work on the greenery team. Oh, really? Yeah. I mean, greenery was well. I love it. Yeah. I love that greenery. Yeah. I mean, that's how we used to make HTML. Yeah. So okay. So you select this. Select this thing. And how does it actually know? Well, do you tell it something on the MCP server? Like, in your prompt. Did you have to tell it? Yes. We'll control it. Let me see. You know, come on. If you have the task open or like the task list, something. Yeah. Great. There it is. Okay. Replace the homepage with the profile form as currently selected in Figma. Right. That's that's going to use that get code. And we'll went that form and store responses in a MongoDB that you can manage with the MongoDB. It's a piece server. And it did a really good job. Check it out. I mean, actually like it called all this stuff. And I got all this information. And then it built out. It's, it's requirements dog as a design doc. And yeah, I think you're right. My, my, my on goal here was that I, I just asked it to take up more than, you know, more than, it was the kind of thing that I would consider my. What granularity. Maybe too much. Yeah. But like again, you know, you're talking to like your junior here and kind of telling you, hey, listen, this is the exact things you need to do. So if we go back to your, to your prompt here. So so the best way to do this like, in a little bit more of a tactical approach will be like, I'm creating an application that does this. Right. Yes. Yeah. I didn't even contextualize that. That's true. My application is supposed to take user input. And it's supposed to store it in a MongoDB table because. Oh, that's a good idea. Right. Right. Please start with the following. Take the. The visual elements or make a form. Make a form. And put it in a chance. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. Is this what I want? And then you say, yes, that's what I want. It's good. Save it done. All the tax done. And then at that level, also go over and create the steering. There's things. Once I got an app running. Yeah. Then then take what that we're doing in because of this because that all of that kind of thing. And you'll probably end up with like a couple of couple of, I don't know, three or four, spectacular, development. Yeah, sure. That's fine. And then you have more control of work over what happened, right? Because like, if you see my, I'll put this screenshot. An example of my, I have like three or four specs for each different feature. I want to add. And like I've seen people's project with a multiple like 10, 15 specs for just adding features. Yeah. And I think it's, it's not even like a feature. I think it's like a feature about feature. Like if you, even if you want to add another element to the form. Yeah. You can just tell us, please add another element to this form. Here's a new Figma file. Yeah. Oh. Or yeah. Or just kind of follow the existing. Exactly. So, so that will make cure work a lot better with this because number one, you're going to spend way less of it. Yeah. Yeah. Shout out to the book. Number two, it's going to be a lot more self-contained because I'm biggest problem with cloning systems is this. The fact that I'm losing the grasp of it. Like, like, it starts to be tough and I'm like, I know. Where did you go? There's a couple of moments in here where I'm like, literally I hit the cancel button. I'm like, buddy. Stop. Stop. Stop. Okay. I just want to see a form. Exactly. Yeah. That should have been a trigger for me to like be maybe I'm using this tool. Yeah. Because I mean, if it's even doing this. I mean, you know, this is the thing. We're all learning. Like, yeah. People on this court on the on the on the cure of this court have been like sharing a bunch of best practices. And they've all been in countering these kinds of things. And I'm like, oh, no, you should actually do it this way. So, oh, cool. Excellent. The link to this court in the doobuzu. I need to jump on that. You should definitely. So, and it's like one of these things has become really obvious. Also, on one more thing that was that has proven to be really good is existing application. Adding features to it. So, like, oh, yeah. From scratch, it's kind of like, There's a lot of existing art. It can be so you go through it and you can say, oh, I see what you're doing here. It's not ever you're doing it. But really doing it. Exactly. Exactly. Is there an application running? Is it? Yeah. Well, I think in my passion. Yeah, let's say. Okay. Hold on. Oops. You know. Typing on camera. Kids, not for the week of heart. Okay. Actually, probably right now. You also love the local whole swap site. It's my favorite swap site. Yeah, right? Okay. So, that's right. Yeah. Second only to 127 and zero zero one. Yeah. Yeah. That's really cool. Yeah. They're pretty good. Yeah. Can you go back to the thing? Yeah. Did it actually. I actually did a couple more additional things. I created some steps and stuff. Yeah. Oh, actually hold on. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're not. Did you say it to me? I kind of like. Okay. Hold on. Okay. So, this was the original one. Let's go. There we go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Which I get was a bad prompt. It's like, what is this thing? Sure. I don't know. I did. I basically just pulled this example from, you know. Yeah. Something. Sure. I just did was comparing figment mcp with just giving claw to the screen shot. Right. And it's funny because in the past, it actually, like, clawed it one out every time. Really? Okay. And then on the day of recording. Okay. It turned out that that figment mcp actually in plus sonnet in, in situ. Sure. Actually worked first time in here. Okay. Better. So whatever. But yeah. So I used this for that. And then yeah. So that's why you're seeing some stuff. It wasn't in that. But again. But with this because, like, this makes all a lot more sense. Right. Right. That is true. I can't even tell you what some of this. I love it. Generally. Like, what does plays a bird mean? And why is it a drop down? Like, I mean, you're going to have a drop down every place on earth. Like, none of this even makes sense. There's this wonderful reddit read about the worst volume sliders. Oh, right. Oh, yeah. Right. Like, what is that? So we should ask you to make the worst. It actually tried. It was like, oh, well, I'm going to allow you to have like an input view. Oh, of course. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. What does go to next? What does next mean? What's the next one? I don't know. It doesn't specify. It did a good job with the information it had. It did. Okay. You're right. Yeah. Well, that's cool. So like, before we wrap up, can you give me, can you give them your, some of your tips now that you've kind of been playing around it, specifically when it comes to MCP servers and, like, Kiro, one or two, three, whatever. Teach me. Yeah. I learned from using Kiro that I haven't told you. I know. I mean, I learned a lot during this. I got to say. Okay. Yeah. No. The granularity of tasks has to be a lot smaller than what you'd anticipate being talking to just another kind of fellow engineer, which is, which is, which is the level that I'm used to working when we work out these kind of specs. We have those, like, super long planning sessions, where it's like, okay. You know, and you get down to like the, that hour level task granularity and they're, like, seriously, like, we're spending 10 hours on this. But, um, yeah. So, sort of, like, granularize a lot more. But I do think that the world of MCP is going to open up a panacea to you from, like, traditional LLM, like, the LLM without MCP. And there's just so many good ones out there nowadays. Yeah. Don't sleep on MCP's friends? Oh, Lord. Make your own MCP. Yeah. Absolutely. Like, I kept, I, well, to be honest, any MCP you think about, they're probably exist. How many minutes? Yeah. They're so prevalent these days. But, make your own MCP's. Oh, another good hip tip. Okay. So, I didn't notice the cure-o, in this case. It didn't take an SSE URL. Okay. As part of the spec. Sure. Um, four in MCP server. You're right. Whereas, so what I ended up doing was, I ended up using this MTP remote and then giving it that URL. Yeah. Other tools will have it, so you've just put in the URL. And there you go. Sure. That cure will get there. And just, like, today, this is a way around that. Exactly. That's how it works. Like, even if it legit, you want to do, like, there's an official AWS knowledge base, MCP server that's running on, like, not local holds, but running somewhere else. Oh, nice. You have to use the MCP remote in cure-o. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the early days of MCP. Yeah. It's cool. Cool. It's, there's obviously a ton of upside with it. But right now, like, ah, yes. Just, I don't know who it is. The man has been at us. I mean, amazing. Well, thank you so much, Jack. Thank you so much for showing this to me. Um, folks, make sure to go ahead and subscribe to Jack's channel. We're going to leave a link in the description down below. Um, if you've enjoyed today's video, there's a big, like, like button. Yeah. Like and subscribe. Somewhere here. You like and subscribe. If you want to see more content, the subscribe button is also there. Um, you should also join our Discord channel. This is for.ggs, let cure-o.dev link in the description. Yeah. Anytime you use any tool like this, join the Discord. Yeah. And I'm going to go ahead and teach Jack now. What is objective to the best program I've ever known. So, I'm just wrong. To which, of course, right.
