To tackle specialized dev and deployment use cases,
Kiro powers bundle expertise in MCP servers, steering files,
and hooks that can be dynamically loaded by Kiro agents only when needed.
Here's an example of how you can use a Kiro power to add payments functionality
to an existing SAS application.
You can download a Kiro power from Stripe at Kiro.dev
and after installing it, it becomes available to Kiro agents in IDE.
Ask Kiro to activate it and add a subscription for a SAS app to charge a user.
Using the Stripe power, Kiro will interact directly with Stripe
and create a product, price, and a payment link in your Stripe Dashboard.
Once complete, you can ask Kiro to confirm that additional subscription handing logic
is already integrated into your application.
Then, you can deploy the application, for example, using CDK on AWS Serverless Infrastructure.
After deployment, you are ready to run a front-end React app
to confirm the ability to log into your account and create a subscription.
The subscription now allows anyone to make a payment using credit card information
and add an unlimited plan for your project.
Empower Kiro agents with specialized expertise.
Anyone can build and share.
